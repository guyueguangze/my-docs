# Overview
This document takes you through the main functions of the cloud platform.
#   
### Registration and login
Users need to register before they can use the functions of quantum computer. After filling in the relevant information, due to security reasons, the background will conduct an audit within one working day, and they can use the simulator and quantum computer programming functions of the platform after passing the audit.

After the review is completed, users can enter their user name and password on the login page, and then they can access all the functions of the cloud platform.

### Resource
After login, users can view all available quantum computers in the "Computer list". In the list of computers, the cloud platform displays brief information about quantum computers, including quantum computer number, quantum computer bits, and the topology of computer chips.

User click Select Click on a quantum computer to see its parameters. Since current quantum computers are affected by noise, the detailed information list shows the error rate of each bit (calculated based on a single qubit Pauili error), the color of the nodes on the graph, and the accuracy rate of adjacent bits as gates (calculated based on CZ Pauli error), corresponding to the parameters on the top of the graph.

### Project
Users can use the quantum computer listed in the "Computer List" to program, click project management, users can view, create or delete a project. A project is like a package, which can contain multiple quantum programming codes that can be imported into each other, which can be compiled to generate executable quantum circuits and submitted to a simulator or quantum computer.

### Forum
The cloud platform provides a learning forum to facilitate communication and communication between users and platform developers. All registered users can access the cloud platform for Posting, Posting content including learning experience, problems encountered in learning, suggestions on the cloud platform and encountered in the use of errors, forum administrators will be in the review will be important or can help other users post show, and will update the platform dynamic in the form of post continuous announcement.
